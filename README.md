### A Personal Note

This project was a fantastic journey into C programming, terminal manipulation, and a sneak into game development. From figuring out the logic, to developing the UI, every step was a learning experience. Thus, completing my First year's learnings with this project, Thank you for checking it out!
Made with chaos, color, and lots of caffeine.
